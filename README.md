A web-based JavaScript application, 'offie.' utilises the Google Maps JavaScript API to make searches for currently open supermarkets and  shops based on an address, or a user's location. Results are displayed in both text-form, and on an interactive Google Map.

The user can customize some settings of the application, such as whether to use a 'light' or a 'dark' theme, and which units to display distances in. These settings are saved using cookies, so that the settings will be active the next time the user loads the page.

All of this aims to provide the user with useful results through an incredibly straight-forward to use application, which makes concise yet common search queries for them.
